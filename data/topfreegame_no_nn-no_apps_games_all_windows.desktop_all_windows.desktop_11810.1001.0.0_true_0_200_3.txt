So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

The perfect brain workout for everyone.\r\nOur chess game brings classic chess game into a new dimension. Do you want to learn or improve your chess knowledge? Do you want to master the most prestigious, the classiest game ever?\r\nChess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chess board, a checkered game board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. In a standard game of chess, each of the two players begins a game with the following 16 pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\n\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how chess pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\n\r\nChess is played by millions of people worldwide, both amateurs and professionals.\r\n\r\nThen our chess game guarantees you to improve your chess skill and also will give you hours of enjoyment trying to solve the puzzles.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and fun chess experience you can find! \r\n\r\nHurry!

Please read the tutorial the first time you start the game.\r\n\r\nYou control by using the keyboard, mouse and/or touch controls.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and enjoy this FREE game from Wilhelmsen Studios!\r\n\r\nThanks to NASA who has provided SFX and the model of the Saturn V rocket.\r\nwww.darksidejam.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9NC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"BlackjackFree","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42061.9007199266252112.81f11f1c-88d3-47de-9670-2a69502d5933.a991306c-48ce-4c0e-9b5c-3b739133fca2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26499.9007199266252112.34328320-3eae-4c8d-ae36-f29521d6ce9c.ad38d0c4-0b06-4bb7-afe2-9ed5e082bb31","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10352.9007199266252112.3f9a5422-8484-42d9-81b9-2d6834b24158.05011409-5e22-419e-a99a-b2bbb60d7fe4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4204.9007199266252112.c3f3a917-b4ee-460a-a2a0-98d7c2d94518.257ed31e-6e80-400e-b414-d354a3bfe265","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47762.9007199266252112.1b1dbeef-572e-49ca-a9bd-2411ca811305.851ae504-a0a1-4148-b73e-83d9b038befd","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55207.9007199266252112.3136d1b1-0134-4e1d-88d0-967d5f73bda5.e23acb7d-c285-4cd9-822a-b3076fb054fa","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46198.9007199266252112.844d497c-51ce-4df7-8f2d-4a37047ce527.09118ce2-8583-417f-9179-f8c432c05530","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50168.9007199266252112.d5478131-331c-4f02-afb9-a45e59cfc0d0.4f2eb98e-1a7b-4b8d-bbfc-929923e6503a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41173.9007199266252112.3e29d0b6-4f57-44ef-9766-0d425fde9de0.1572b803-48ba-4eb3-8635-3ee54fd9fb93","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["46558DhirendraRastogi.BlackjackFree_ybpw1wm87vwpt"],"ContentIds":["d7c72a3e-602d-eb39-de06-c431b1cffb81","1338ddb5-1c2f-ee7e-4954-8106202cd1e5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobiltelefon","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Casino style blackjack gameplay - with virtual money, soothing music and cool sound effects.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCHB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"2020: My Country","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2027.9007199266251727.c99285d0-1dcb-4986-84a0-6b7006fc0aad.4a3254a1-78d9-4e10-b7f5-c83e9c4c2d49","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46945.9007199266251727.8cadd5de-a9e6-439b-9092-cb6b91a74304.8a357fb7-9431-4409-bc61-66605497f5a3","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31537.9007199266251727.a75fd6c8-cc52-4916-8941-abc71a8206b9.ed513c4d-47af-4745-a0e6-4dfbb1bf8aa9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38334.9007199266251727.3f5ee51a-d811-42aa-80f1-c7546e6d416e.ade94de6-b47b-4c32-84dd-49553129444d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54693.9007199266251727.4c74deba-0bae-4e71-8738-a657c43f2962.6a347e4b-f28e-4cd8-8268-765f7281de0a","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42735.9007199266251727.b919854f-d89d-4a7a-bd63-b714278328db.88f0062c-82cf-43d7-ac85-e60b31fc75f8","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10085.9007199266251727.b839453e-35fd-4da9-baf6-7a7ace949507.96e3ccd1-c6c8-4ac3-9351-a36b64e6670e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28739.9007199266251727.5e3d0aa4-6298-4f0c-8e55-d34527934700.401c1935-dc43-4270-b0db-6cca9069c992","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.52510.9007199266251727.76fc5125-f95a-4a36-a46f-4018031e67cf.28af6f13-de7e-4e0b-8226-a833bf21aec5","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.61732.9007199266251727.441a7300-8e25-44c1-9a91-30c3abdaa325.73e7cea7-21aa-4a47-94e9-1dc28fa33a2a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#26222D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"165","PackageFamilyNames":["0EB8BD08.2020MyCountry_erk4rrwmt7jyt"],"ContentIds":["855e201b-8234-6395-4e87-6113bc8745c8","e903e3aa-eadd-2e1d-9a4d-586348d36451","8344a78f-bd79-babc-3e12-2d2d81f292a0","f62fe3c3-a4e1-7ec4-a0d4-a566a8ef41cb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobiltelefon","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"2020: My Country is the follow-up to the smash-hit, city-building strategy game My Country, which has more than 17 million players around the world.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MTMX9FFD7M3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Master Brick Breaker XBox","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29167.13809862548287374.20e718be-0509-46b9-93c3-e64e65d8d70f.11483801-8a3c-4eca-b5e1-d0b6dcda7259","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57239.13809862548287374.0e11cc34-4a3c-41e6-8ed4-46c4b4a06ad6.2586986f-ccaa-458c-8c9b-1bf99638b444","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23986.13809862548287374.8c9e14fa-d7f2-41e7-a59e-021142a835c9.7470bdb7-f5c9-448b-b87d-f2bffd92c0fa","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29332.13809862548287374.731ca434-60a1-48d9-a188-9a300b1f8b05.5599365b-b082-4dc1-b195-407dabbb2967","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56376.13809862548287374.7b9601e5-a900-405f-aaf9-db4144ddea6d.54ad97c8-8e5c-4522-8df3-17714deeb730","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["53388MutantBearGames.MasterBrickBreakerXBox_5pfgqq4dahhzr"],"ContentIds":["37fe050e-709d-b39d-ddaf-2a945adc3050","4417eabc-1199-3043-90c0-43da9013d6d3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Master Brick Breaker is a very addictive classic brick breaker game \r\nwith online scoreboards and 2 player game (versus and cooperative).\r\n\r\n200 stages, tons of power-ups, screen effects, unlimited play and classic brick breaker gameplay.

To win you must avoid getting the scoring cards. Or you can Shoot the Moon. The game is over when one of the four players gains more or exactly 100 points. You win if you have the smallest score. Though chance is involved you can still make the best of your cards and win. Download and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ��� ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Advanced AI players \r\n✓ 3 Difficulty Levels\r\n✓ Balanced rules\r\n✓ Intuitive interface \r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ You can keep low and try to earn the lowest score by avoiding cards of hearts and especially by avoiding the 13-points Queen of ♠Spades. \r\n✓ Another strategy is to go big and take all the hearts and the Queen of ♠Spades, in which case you \"Shoot the Moon\". It will either take 26 points away or add 26 points to all your opponents. When at least one player goes over or reaches 100 points the game is over.\r\n✓ The scoring cards are the cards of hearts, each worth 1 point, and the Queen of ♠Spades, worth 13 points. Whoever plays the highest card of the suit that started the trick collects the trick. The value of the cards grows in this order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.\r\n✓ 13 cards are dealt to each player. Before every hand, each player has to choose 3 cards and pass them to another player with one exception. For every fourth hand no cards are passed. The player holding the 2♣ of clubs must lead to begin the first trick.\r\n✓ Players must follow suit. If you don't have a card of the suit which started the trick you can place any card.\r\n✓ Players can start tricks with a card from any suit, with one exception: the cards of hearts. Placing a card of hearts in the trick for the first time is called breaking the hearts. Once the hearts are broken you can start a trick with a card of hearts.\r\n✓ Sometimes you can collect all the scoring cards and thus you shoot the moon. In most cases you will receive 0 points and the others will each receive 26 points.\r\n✓ However, if by adding 26 points to other players they gain more than 100 points, but you still lose, another solution is preferred. In this case 26 points will be subtracted from your score and all the other players will keep their scores.\r\n✓ By default the set difficulty is easy. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change it from easy to medium, from medium to hard or from hard to easy. And the next time when you play a new hand, the AI will employ better strategies or not depending on your preferred difficulty level.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n\r\n✓ You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace. \r\n\r\n✓ On the board you will find a pyramid of cards and a stack from which you draw cards. If there are no available matches you can continue to draw from the stack.\r\n\r\n✓ You can draw the entire stack three times over. Once there are no more turns to draw you can deal a new deck of cards.\r\n\r\n✓ You can only deal two times. If you eliminate a pyramid of cards, you complete one board and you receive an extra deal.\r\n\r\n✓ For each pair you receive 10 points. You receive bonus points when you continue to match pairs without drawing new cards. \r\n\r\n✓ You receive 2000 points for completing one board.\r\n\r\n✓ When you run out of options, you can tap Hint for a suggestion.\r\n\r\n✓ You can also undo a move by pressing Undo.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\r\n\r\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. \r\n\r\nThe first person to move all 4 pieces into the home wins.\r\n\r\nHave you ever missed the classic family entertainment of the Ludo board that we used to play on as kids? \r\n\r\nWell now you can play Ludo Free with friends- the timeless game and enjoy it with your family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nSo why not make it a reality by playing this game and reliving your childhood days?\r\n\r\nDownload Ludo for free and recall your childhood!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Ludo Free Features ◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ 2, 3 or 4 player mode (Local co-op and Bots)\r\n✔ All time classic family ludo game\r\n✔ User friendly interface\r\n✔ Free to play\r\n\r\nPlease rate and give your feedback for Ludo Free for further improving the game.\r\n\r\nWe will be grateful to hear your opinions and improve - whenever needed - in future versions.\r\n\r\nEnjoy playing Ludo anywhere anytime, Free!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6L8CQNDB16","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cake Shop: Bakery Chef Story","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49993.14016343485837643.310f5599-ee5d-4d14-a716-be4ddfb74c0e.ef045d23-3fe4-43c7-9065-77f3c652bc04","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32612.14016343485837643.310f5599-ee5d-4d14-a716-be4ddfb74c0e.b743bbfa-2e1b-4dc2-9ad0-d0afa78efc43","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["9867BlockPuzzleGames.CakeShopBakeryChefStory_dbwkae47netvc"],"ContentIds":["3afe282d-d7fe-31fd-7b5a-62e0d728fb7f","b13e963b-0678-d321-f0b7-ccc547aa781d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobiltelefon","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"** Exciting news for all baking games lovers and aspiring cooking chefs – with ❤ Cake Shop: Bakery Chef Story ❤ you can now open your mobile cake bakery and travel the world while making and decorating delicious vanilla, chocolate or strawberry cakes for your loyal customers!

You’ve just found the most original coin dozer casino simulator that blends perfectly with your world explorer and treasure hunting games taste! Our unique arcade provides not only the classic coin dropper gameplay, but it mixes it with a treasure hunt for giving you a unique coin dozer experience in different level locations like: Treasure Cave, Gold of Ra, Diamond Rock & Temple of Venus!\r\n\r\nThe infamous red-bearded pirate left behind his treasure maps!  It seems like your luck already started changing because now, you have all the treasures locations. Begin your treasure hunt quest now, to collect all the coins & prizes of the huge lots inside the chests. Be careful though; the red-bearded pirate left some traps & fake treasure chests to keep safe his gold coins & jewels. The traps can cause that most of the coins and goodies fall to the sides of the dozer machine; so be really careful when you tap!\r\n\r\n💰🔦💰 Let the treasures chase & the coin dash dozer fun action begins! Download NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest and enjoy the tons of prizes & high winning rates! 💰🔦💰\r\n\r\nNot familiar with Coin Dozer free games rules? No problem! It works almost the same like the real coin pusher games machines, and you’ll see a short video tutorial. Tap the pusher to make coins drop on it. All the coins or prizes that fall on the sides won’t be counted on your balance. The main goal is to drop coins & have them pushing over the front edge of the platforms. Our game includes incredible boosters that will help you on your cash collect quest. Check every booster special power & actions in the help section to build your winner strategy! Use the power ups wisely, as some of them don’t regenerate so fast as others. Gain XP points to increase your experience bar and unlock more maps and game levels. Our dozer can compete with the best prize claw machines or simulators in rewards matter; but unlike the claw machine, your chances of winning are much higher!\r\n\r\n🎊💀🎊 Collect all the special items like gold bars or secret boxes to conquer all the secret rewards hidden among the chests treasures! Try NOW Coin Dozer: Treasure Quest FREE for limited time only! 🎊💀🎊\r\n\r\nIf you get stuck, use the Shake option; every collected coin fills your Shake meter. You can activate it when it reaches one of the three levels: Low, Medium or High. Activating this feature shakes the table making the coins on the edge fall off the table. Collect 4 or more coins at once to trigger a Coin Attack; this will create and spread special goodies, prizes and puzzle pieces. Once you collect all the gold puzzle pieces, 12 to be exact, you’ll open the secret door of the room which contains a huge amount of rewards. Puzzle mini games unlock at level 5, and from there each level of our dozer has a puzzle mini-game to solve. Keep gaining XP to collect all the surprise rewards waiting for you!\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N9JL5Z5V2WW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Vampire - Hidden Object Adventure Games for Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37366.13536215027241994.93624bdc-7ac5-4fa7-aa30-8ffbc00f647f.89ecdd50-f6c4-4d87-bc1c-b6276b126cb1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2465.13536215027241994.93624bdc-7ac5-4fa7-aa30-8ffbc00f647f.2fd27ccf-9b75-4e87-af1f-bacdd4de37a9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9519.13536215027241994.93624bdc-7ac5-4fa7-aa30-8ffbc00f647f.90306a3d-bf7b-4f1d-ba6c-45c2630fe433","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40965.13536215027241994.93624bdc-7ac5-4fa7-aa30-8ffbc00f647f.b6fecff7-fa5d-48ab-a47b-d43a23179f06","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38552CrispApp.Vampire-HiddenObjectAdventureGamesfo_pnrt47fe6g5q6"],"ContentIds":["7169e21b-4920-7687-85c6-68dcc08c81cd","fd5f2280-03ac-a077-2455-db4a2df128b5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobiltelefon","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"- What can be more exciting than playing with the Evil?

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1R48S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dress Up: Royal Wedding","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35989.13510798886153975.b7e33b4b-0909-46e8-9fe7-66e72468b4f8.f357466e-78ba-4311-a97a-f872d0cbb709","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38310.13510798886153975.5da7025d-6a17-48fa-a31f-0f5affcdf61f.4f0405f4-3e4c-4777-98eb-224776d3d45d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25518.13510798886153975.6f06aeed-07e8-4f97-a9ed-56e433b450b1.6fe0b81a-0043-46d0-9806-f2a50f0e17fc","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24596.13510798886153975.e33d89b1-aeea-4bfb-af17-422ae04826bf.35046096-542b-4f93-84c6-cd185e7798d3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37096.13510798886153975.1d5c96b7-d535-4dca-9603-534cc6d8ae50.1a05df8e-cdb4-42f6-8b31-6d9f72b69464","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["29654uslight.DressUpRoyalWedding_j11n5d0xh9kme"],"ContentIds":["f1c396ae-1e7f-1d8b-e226-6189f0e17b08","9f03adcf-4612-3cde-61e0-da14e1afce6c","542c235e-be0f-8e17-5396-7021b2042341"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobiltelefon","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a free game for girls.
