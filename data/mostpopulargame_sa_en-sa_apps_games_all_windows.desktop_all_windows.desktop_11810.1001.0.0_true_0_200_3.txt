Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\r\n\r\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. \r\n\r\nThe first person to move all 4 pieces into the home wins.\r\n\r\nHave you ever missed the classic family entertainment of the Ludo board that we used to play on as kids? \r\n\r\nWell now you can play Ludo Free with friends- the timeless game and enjoy it with your family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nSo why not make it a reality by playing this game and reliving your childhood days?\r\n\r\nDownload Ludo for free and recall your childhood!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Ludo Free Features ◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ 2, 3 or 4 player mode (Local co-op and Bots)\r\n✔ All time classic family ludo game\r\n✔ User friendly interface\r\n✔ Free to play\r\n\r\nPlease rate and give your feedback for Ludo Free for further improving the game.\r\n\r\nWe will be grateful to hear your opinions and improve - whenever needed - in future versions.\r\n\r\nEnjoy playing Ludo anywhere anytime, Free!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N1V2RHBB56C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Extreme Drift","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8880.13964427989483492.be736136-709c-4da5-80bd-355a08e710dd.8c62797e-901a-4933-84de-e920e235955c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41913.13964427989483492.f8f8355e-a647-432c-9498-936e4326ca66.6575a9b9-f11d-4e15-bf49-31b43daccaed","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59849.13964427989483492.6a508761-811e-431e-97b4-d6bf4cb114e4.4afe1666-39d3-4349-81f6-99b240a73d77","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2739ChimpiGames.ExtreamDrift_7pgfw3wsaeyma"],"ContentIds":["0e4131ea-a145-fc7e-6c8a-33d40b842c10","06c837d4-c0ed-2ee1-5b03-77d3b9153895"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Extreme Drift is the best car simulator of 2018, thanks to its advanced real physics engine \r\nEver wanted to try a sports car simulator?

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The idea of the game is to get to your last card, shout Ho-Uno before another player realises you didn’t, and then attempt to play your last card on your turn to win the round. The player to use up the last card wins the round and is scored based on the cards left in their opponent’s hand.\r\n\r\nEach player is dealt 7 cards with the remaining ones placed face down to form a draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to begin a discard pile.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to shout Ho-Uno. Points are scored by ridding yourself of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for cards left in your opponent's hands.\r\n\r\nThe first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number, color or word or the player can throw down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have anything to match, he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great. \r\nOtherwise play moves to the next person.\r\n\r\nWild Card gives the players a chance to experience an all new game changing experience!\r\n\r\nWhen you have one card left, you must shout Ho-Uno (meaning one). Failure to do this results in you having to pick two cards from the draw pile. That is, of course if you get caught by the other players.\r\n\r\nIt's the number and colour matching game of cards that's fun and easy for kids of all ages. \r\n\r\nHo-Uno is challenging and enjoyable for card players of any skill level and age. When it comes to fun games for the whole family, Ho-Uno is the family game that provides hours of entertainment for all.\r\n\r\nLike most card games, Ho-Uno trains concentration, memory, and reaction time.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun game to have available when everyone is sitting around bored, looking for something to do.\r\n\r\nUnlike lots of other games, Ho-Uno is still fun even when you have played it many times.\r\n\r\nDownload Ho-Uno for your phone and tablets today and have endless hours of fun.\r\n\r\n★★★★ Ho-Uno Features ★★★★\r\n\r\n❖ Three strategic AI players\r\n❖ 3 action cards and 2 Wild cards \r\n❖ Extremely rich UI\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to Rate and Review Ho-Uno so that we can make the game better! \r\n\r\nEnjoy playing Ho-Uno!!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRD1ZV9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Police Bus Staff Duty Transport 3D - Pick and Drop","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42260.9007199267158086.4594fafa-ebc4-4855-a813-d1dfff9b0afe.5cc44d70-2531-4093-bf19-a50ab830b0d4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13010.9007199267158086.b2e2995f-ffd5-42b6-88f0-e14ccfc4af34.64ca181e-8791-4c9b-96ce-a85db9102baf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.4,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["14859AppStreamStudios.PoliceBusStaffDutyTransport3_ykgtwtztg31z8"],"ContentIds":["40b290f2-3990-dd49-1be4-c790c91cf9a3","20c37942-0dff-4644-8033-057f4a4c0619"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help out the police department by picking and dropping cops to duty so that they can reach in time and help fight criminals.
