It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1R62S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Roller Coaster Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6870.13510798886163587.090e4879-1a70-4eaa-89bc-50df78302c8b.aad92981-639a-4254-87e5-c39c6da355c7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41863.13510798886163587.ba503e86-20bb-4a39-81c0-1aade5a5abe5.191fc44a-61dd-4e82-8899-3cc5acbbd615","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.RealRollerCoasterSimulator_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["adc393f2-4b9c-10a3-70a3-46ddd1981c58","50a701dc-f1d5-6f3a-f46c-9a95a252c9ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you are looking for Roller Coaster Games that has huge enthusiastic moments and collections of stunning wonderful HD display and graphics, the search is over!!

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.\r\nBackgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.\r\nYou could play against the very intelligent computer or against other players.\r\nKeep playing ","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NM6RM10KV2S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snail Bob 5","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25403.13697876011905715.92802071-39d4-4d83-8b1e-8da2f2df341b.105490a5-4389-47c0-baeb-4235210ee46f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32982.13697876011905715.92802071-39d4-4d83-8b1e-8da2f2df341b.9d211dfe-054e-4262-a47f-8c1dd55682d2","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["39135goatgame.SnailBob5_p6fh3swgmjcvc"],"ContentIds":["1bf3ac05-e6c0-b803-daaa-0bcf081ead4b","b277506b-d601-8a6f-4478-6d8a0d08e800"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In the previous episodes you were helping the brave Snail Bob to reach his new house.

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

As in a puzzle, you have a board and you must find out which symbol – or piece - goes in each box  \r\n\r\n👽 and where is the logic?\r\n🙂 the game gives you logical clues, so you can deduce what symbol goes in what box  \r\n\r\n👽 What do you mean by logical clues?\r\n🙂 the logical clues are of the style of:  these pieces are on the board and these others are not, or only one of these two is correct, or at least one of these two pieces is not correct. or ...  \r\n\r\n👽 and that is logic?\r\n🙂 Absolutely. It’s based on the propositional logic. Propositional logic is universal, and all of us use it even without noticing it.\r\n\r\nIt means that everyone can to follow this logic. Apparently, the clues hide the response of the game, but from the clues you can deduce the correct answers  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it like in an intriguing or detective novel?\r\n🙂 You can also see it that way. The reasoning can be similar, you must find a clue to start, chain clues, follow false leads and discard them, realize that if something is false, it can mean that something else is true. \r\n\r\nYes, in fact, every time we reason in a logical way, we do it in the same way: in a logical way  \r\n\r\n👽 Ok, start to like me. Tell me more\r\n🙂I assure you that when you deduct the clues and arrive at the solution you take a joy. \r\n\r\nThe challenge is fun. \r\n\r\nIt's not exactly liked a novel or a detective movie because the game is totally symbolic. It is a board game and you can play again and again, and each game is different  \r\n\r\n👽 but it seems that you should use the same skill, right? \r\n🙂 Certainly, as we have said before, the logic used in ItsLogic is universal. You can even see it as a logic gym. \r\n\r\nIn that sense, you can be sure that it will help you develop your logical thinking while you are enjoying yourself  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it easy?\r\n🙂 You can imagine that you start easy and it gets complicated, but with ItsLogic  you can always decide the level of complexity in which you want to play in each moment. \r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes you want to play a series of simple and fast games, while other times you want the challenge of a complex game    \r\n\r\n👽 What if you get stuck?\r\n🙂 Practically all of us will find levels of the game that are easy for us, other levels that will be a challenge and other levels that seem impossible.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to dominate the game the bar will go up and more and more games will be affordable.\r\n\r\nBut sooner or later, as normal, we can find games that we do not know how to deal with:  You get stuck, and that is annoying.\r\n\r\nMany times, we would just need an idea, or an example, other times we would just have to have some tool, such as being able to point out what we are deducting, or that something or someone tells you what the next step is. ItsLogic knows that\r\n\r\nItsLogic has a lot of help tools so you never get stuck. You can use the tools to learn, to get a push or just to adapt the game to the level of complexity you want. \r\n\r\nStaying stuck is not fun and solving games is fun. \r\n\r\nWith ItsLogic you can solve from the simplest game to the most complex. It's part of the game.\r\n\r\n👽 It's logical, I'm going to develop my logical thinking while I'm having fun, I'm not going to be alone if I get stuck ... I'm going to try it\r\n\r\n🙂 Well, sounds logical\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVQ98LCK36L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pet Doctor: Virtual Pet","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44718.13854598092757853.42a58a10-da5c-4c4c-81ef-108ae0e4ddf7.44164b01-3b72-413c-9fe8-4d1287b2721c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63948.13854598092757853.42a58a10-da5c-4c4c-81ef-108ae0e4ddf7.87e20600-b4dc-41d3-a278-b97d85fa0a03","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["54917CheetahPvPGames.PetDoctorVirtualPet_1211aek6hfxsa"],"ContentIds":["3792fabc-af19-78e1-2f46-40f11690f44c","d017476e-0030-3499-36ce-fdd7a2910e72"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Take care of sick adorable and cute pets !
