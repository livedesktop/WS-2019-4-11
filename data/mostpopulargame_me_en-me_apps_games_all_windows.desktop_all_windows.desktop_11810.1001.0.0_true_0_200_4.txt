Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home.

from city to snowy hills and mountains. The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe.

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NN5HK4JP9SV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Detective Sherlock Holmes : Hidden Objects .

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X04F","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"¼ Learn Sight Read Music Notes - ¼Solfa","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3434.13510798887536098.f280b45a-90aa-4e12-a0d7-16f427ea58c5.3dd49425-f8ab-455d-a9eb-b97d57910271","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30457.13510798887536098.c34f6d9e-4008-4398-a83d-8b60a91cc986.0c805df9-6d8b-43a3-a3f6-33095891125f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32612.13510798887536098.6162b9f6-4b82-4969-8b37-57c9430140a2.e7ec94cc-8886-400f-ab9c-5e8cc08dbefc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1615.13510798887536098.a699282c-9bd4-4c6f-a1f3-47ac284ca349.9d78260a-17ff-4144-b8a4-4a652d50ebb8","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59193.13510798887536098.3f972d7c-ebde-4eaf-bd9d-c88c7eb1a1e3.094d4916-07b4-4247-9702-a76fae664637","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47581.13510798887536098.29dd0e93-ca7a-4257-965c-29d527e2eeae.7683b786-9491-4642-a295-f3f7b94a0a48","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46870.13510798887536098.81fd4197-2aa8-45bb-a7f8-21e9ad346b9e.281cff5d-84e3-4658-a3d8-9fcf4ee56424","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35420.13510798887536098.a75434b5-d139-4ace-a6d9-29dd98796040.e3f2a839-b4df-439c-86ce-f700ccad2c2b","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13527.13510798887536098.253cdc04-c91d-4c34-8367-27ae7eb88e47.8e05cb87-f240-4656-aebb-6ac9fce92031","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32612.13510798887536098.6162b9f6-4b82-4969-8b37-57c9430140a2.e7ec94cc-8886-400f-ab9c-5e8cc08dbefc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["26373ngfSoft.LearnSightReadMusicNotes-Solfa_6tgm9trbakdya"],"ContentIds":["abc4e597-5eb6-c840-d956-5958206e9994"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"¼ learn sight read music notes\r\n\r\nThis is a limited version with advertisements\r\n\r\nLearn to sight read music in G & F Clef.

Learn on RC-AirSim first and make the maiden flight of your first r/c plane a successful one.\r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite features: \r\n\r\n· Fly a high wing Trainer airplane or an easy to fly Electric Parkflyer.\r\n· Realistic r/c model airplane flight aerodynamics based on NASA flight simulation technology. \r\n· Awesome Crashes! Planes break apart in a realistic physics-based manner. \r\n· Accurate Landings and Ground Handling. \r\n· 3 View Options - R/C, Following (Chase cam), and Onboard camera. Click camera icon to change. \r\n· 4 Channel Controls - aileron, elevator, rudder, throttle. \r\n· Optional On-screen Transmitter Sticks. \r\n· Fly with Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, or Xbox 360 Controller. \r\n· 3 control modes: Mode 2 (default), Mode 1, and 3 Channel. \r\n· Field objects to avoid and fly behind. (Not just a panoramic background photo environment.) \r\n· Doppler-correct sound. \r\n· Get flying quickly! No slow, tedious menus or multiple load screens. \r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite comes with these r/c model airplanes: \r\n\r\n· Back 40 Trainer \r\nClassic 4 channel high-wing trainer with plenty of dihedral for beginners. Powered by a .40 size gas engine. \r\n\r\n· Slowmowatt\r\nElectric park flyer. Flies very slow so there is plenty of time to react. Easiest to fly! Perfect for beginners using the 3 Channel control scheme. 4 channel control available.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: RC-AirSim is a realistic r/c model airplane flight simulator, NOT an arcade game. And like a real model airplane, it will take some practice to master the basics. Luckily, in RC-AirSim, plane crashes are free (and fun)! \r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments? Suggestions?

The rain was pouring down and lightning was striking the trees & mountains outside. Foster thought about his battalion and wondered where they are – the weather had made him loose his tracks. He tried to make plans to go out as soon as the weather gets better and regroup with his men and find his way out in this unknown valley.\r\n\r\nThe morning light brought with it calmness to the weather. It was still raining but it was possible to go out and look for his men and hunt for some food.\r\n\r\nIt is time to load up your sniper rifle and jump into the wilds. Play the role of Captain Foster and help him feed himself.

The object is to move the pieces around the board towards your inner table. Once all 15 of your pieces have arrived in the inner table, they can be removed from the board. The first player to remove all his pieces from the board is the winner. Although the play is highly skilful, the fact that the moves rely on the roll of the dice introduces an element of luck allowing even a novice to win the odd game against a world champion.\r\n\r\nBackgammon has been played throughout the world for thousands of years. ZingMagic's version of Backgammon enables you to play this most popular of board games to a high standard anytime, anywhere.
